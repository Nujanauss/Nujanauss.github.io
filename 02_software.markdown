# Commercial software

I worked for a number of years as a front and backend developer at 
[accu:rate](https://www.accu-rate.de/en/),
 who design crowd simulation software in Java.

Primarily, I focussed on a multinational research project which combined 
[crowd simulation software](https://www.accu-rate.de/en/software-crowd-it-en/) in Java and
[Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02811) in Python to 
predict changes in crowd densities in real time.

Communication between components utilised [Google Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers) 
and [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/).

# Scientific software

Throughout my academic career, I have analysed mathematical models in 
[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html), carried out data analysis with 
[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) and 
[R](https://www.r-project.org/), and run many a regression analysis with
[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/products/spss-statistics).

# Web development

I claim no great skill in web development, but I have enjoyed building this website!
It is hosted on
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and is a customised version of 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)'s 
[minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).
