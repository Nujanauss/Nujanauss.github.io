Mathematical modelling and software development are tools. In studying psychology, I look to acquaint myself
 with human behaviour. In this way, I can be human-centred and not tool-centred.   

My thesis concerns how and when medical practitioners fail to value informative evidence. 
In particular, I am investigating the point at which the [zero-sum fallacy](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618818484) manifests.
I am under the supervision of [Professor David Lagnado](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/david_lagnado.html).

The course confers me with 
Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership with the [British Psychological Society](https://www.bps.org.uk).

During my time at Nottingham, I specialised in stochastic models and optimisation. 
I am particularly interested in Probability Theory, Hidden Markov Models, Game Theory, and Stochastic Processes. 
By studying abroad at [University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au)
  for one year, I was able to complete extra courses in these fields.

My thesis analysed the convergent behaviour of a [Deffuant-Wiesbach model](https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219525900000078)
 of opinion formation using numerical analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations on MATLAB.
