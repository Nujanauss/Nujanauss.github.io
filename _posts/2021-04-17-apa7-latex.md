title: "APA-7 Style in LaTeX"
description: Getting APA-7 style in LaTeX
---

Adhering to [APA style guidelines](https://apastyle.apa.org/) is tiresome.
The [current 7th edition](https://apastyle.apa.org/products/publication-manual-7th-edition-paperback) has 428 pages;
enough for even the most masochistic of researchers to let out a little groan. 
Your time is better spent writing, not formatting.

Thankfully, help is at hand — and it's name is 
<a href="https://www.latex-project.org/"><img width="50" src="../../../../assets/post-data/LaTeX_logo.png" alt="LaTeX"></a>.

## Use a ready-made template

To get started, set yourself up with an [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/) account.
 It will make things much easier.
 
You can then make use of this 
[APA-7 style LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-and-sample-for-authoring-apa7-manuscripts/pvhtwcrvcmsp). 
Joy of joys and thanks be to Daniel A. Weiss! 
The template is based on [the apa7 package in CTAN](https://ctan.org/pkg/apa7?lang=en),
 but won't leave you scratching your head.

On its own, this template will solve many of your formatting woes. 
Citation style, page style, table and figure styles, all compliant with APA's exhaustive and exhausting guidelines.
All you have to do is write.

## Add some turbo-boosters

As good as this template is, we can do better. 
Placing figures and tables is still a nuisance, and the bibliography omits DOI entries for some reason.

So, let's get to work!  

First, to keep all of our formatting rules in one place, it's a good idea to create a style file. 
Navigate to the file-tree and create a new file called `preamble.sty`.

We still need all the stylistic rules Daniel provided to us, so
head back over to `longsample.tex`, cut out the following lines and paste them into your style file:
```
\usepackage[american]{babel}
\usepackage{csquotes}
\usepackage[style=apa,sortcites=true,sorting=nyt,backend=biber]{biblatex}
\DeclareLanguageMapping{american}{american-apa}
```

In their place, write `\usepackage{preamble}`, so that the `.tex` file uses the style file.

(You can delete `\usepackage{lipsum}`, you won't need it.)

### Speed up writing

Now, we can move on to personalising the experience.

Writing out `parencite` and `textcite` to create in-text citations is a little unnecessary.
Instead, let's go for `citep` and `cite`, for citations with and without parentheses, respectively.

To do this, add the following lines to your style file:

```
\let\cite\textcite
\let\citep\parencite
```
 
Now, to cite the <span style="font-style:italic;">Origin of species</span>,
 you need only write `\cite{Darwin1856}`
 for Darwin <a href="#reference" style="color:#36454f;">(1859)</a>,
 and `\citep[e.g.,][]{Darwin1856}`
 for (e.g., Darwin, <a href="#reference" style="color:#36454f;">1859)</a>,
 assuming `Darwin1856` is listed in your bibliography. 
 
### Make hyperlinks work

It's nice to have in-text citations blue.
 This allows the reader's eyes to move over them with ease, and indicates that they are hyperlinks.
Add the following to your style file:
```
\hypersetup{ colorlinks = true, allcolors = {blue} }
```

Unfortunately, this will only colour the year of each in-text citation, 
e.g. Darwin <a href="#reference" style="color:blue;">(1859)</a>. 
This is because only the year is hyperlinked to the bibliography. Another weird feature.   

To hyperlink (and colour) the entire citation, let's make use of [this entry](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/27107) 
on StackExchange, and add the following lines of code to the style file:

```
\DeclareFieldFormat{citehyperref}{
  \DeclareFieldAlias{bibhyperref}{noformat}% Avoid nested links
  \bibhyperref{#1}}

\DeclareFieldFormat{textcitehyperref}{
  \DeclareFieldAlias{bibhyperref}{noformat}% Avoid nested links
  \bibhyperref{
    #1
    \ifbool{cbx:parens}
      {\bibcloseparen\global\boolfalse{cbx:parens}}
      {}}}

\savebibmacro{cite}
\savebibmacro{textcite}

\renewbibmacro*{cite}{
  \printtext[citehyperref]{
    \restorebibmacro{cite}
    \usebibmacro{cite}}}

\renewbibmacro*{textcite}{
  \ifboolexpr{
    ( not test {\iffieldundef{prenote}} and
      test {\ifnumequal{\value{citecount}}{1}} )
    or
    ( not test {\iffieldundef{postnote}} and
      test {\ifnumequal{\value{citecount}}{\value{citetotal}}} )
  }
    {\DeclareFieldAlias{textcitehyperref}{noformat}}
    {}%
  \printtext[textcitehyperref]{
    \restorebibmacro{textcite}
    \usebibmacro{textcite}}}
``` 
 
Now, our entire in-text citation will link to its respective entry in the bibliography, e.g.
<a href="#reference" style="color:blue;">Darwin (1859)</a> — huzzah!  

### Add DOIs

We also need to add DOI entries, where we have them, to the end of any citation.
Because of our previous work, these will also be blue and linked to their respective webpages.

Add 
```
\newcommand*{\doi}[1]{\href{http://dx.doi.org/#1}{https://doi.org/#1}}
 ```
to your style file.

### Set figure and table locations easily

Although this is not always advisable, I found the easiest way to move figures and tables 
was to add `floatsintext` to my document class options. 

That is, 
```
\documentclass[man,floatsintext]{apa7}
``` 
in the main `.tex` file.

### Cherry on top

And we're done! 

There's a few other packages we might like to make use of in the future:

```
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{pdflscape}
\usepackage{ragged2e}
\usepackage{caption}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{hyperref}
```

But for now, it's time to start writing. Use [doi2bib](https://doi2bib.org/)
to automatically generate bib entries using only a DOI, 
copy them into your bibliography, and you're set!

Twenty minutes work — hours of formatting time saved.
