<h4>Have someone on your side.</h4>

<br>

Words are meaningless without context. They are embedded in phrases. Phrases are embedded in sentences. 
And sentences in paragraphs. To write well is to write at each of these levels simultaneously. 

I am passionate about the English language and have a track record of exceptional copy-writing. 

Be it
marketing brochures for a software firm, magazine articles for a gardening website or academic 
literature for publication, I place a high value on choosing the correct words at the correct time.

Eloquence. Clarity. Accuracy. Suitability.
