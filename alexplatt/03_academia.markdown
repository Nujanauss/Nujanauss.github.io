Mathematical modelling and software development are tools. In studying psychology, I look to acquaint myself
 with human behaviour. In this way, I can be human-centred and not tool-centred.

My thesis concerns how and when medical practitioners fail to value informative evidence. 
In particular, I am investigating the point at which the <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618818484" title="">zero-sum fallacy</a> manifests.
I am under the supervision of <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lagnado-lab/david_lagnado.html" title="">Professor David Lagnado</a>

The course confers me with 
Graduate Basis for Chartered Membership with the <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/" title="">British Psychological Society</a>.

<h1>BSc. Mathematics (International Study)</h1> 
</div>
<br>
<p>
During my time at Nottingham, I specialised in stochastic models and optimisation. 
I am particularly interested in Probability Theory, hidden Markov Models, Game Theory, and chaos. 
By studying abroad for one year, I was able to complete extra courses in these fields.

My thesis analysed the convergent behaviour of a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219525900000078" title="">Deffuant-Wiesbach model</a>
 using numerical analysis and Monte-Carlo simulations on MATLAB.
